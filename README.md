# golf_analytics_sql_power_bi

This project is based on discovering insights into one of my passions in recent years... GOLF!

The main purpose was to analyze the performance that professional golf players have had over the years in different tournaments. The dataset used is provided.

Some of the tasks performed include:
- Preparing and importing the data.
- Exploring the details of the dataset, such as the dimensions, field formats, and possible values taken by each field.
- Transformation of the values to obtain interesting information.

The goal is to try to find out the chances of a player making a successful appearance and maybe winning a specific event. It is possible to answer relevant questions such as:
- Players with the most wins and their oldest and latest wins.
- Tournaments which have been won the most times by the same player.
- Players who have been in the top 10 most times.
- Tournaments with the biggest purse.
- Frequency of the players who have made the cut the most times.
- Playing skills of the players who have been in the top 10 the most times.
- And some others...
