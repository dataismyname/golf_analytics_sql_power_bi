# ⛳ Golf Analytics with SQL & Power BI

This project combines two of my passions: **data analysis** and **golf**. Using a historical dataset of professional golf tournaments, the goal was to uncover performance insights and trends among top players over time.

## 📊 Objective

To analyze and visualize players' performance across tournaments using **SQL for data transformation** and **Power BI for dashboard creation**, answering questions such as:

- Which players have the most tournament wins, and when did they happen?
- Which tournaments are dominated by specific players?
- Who are the most consistent players in the Top 10?
- What are the tournaments with the largest purses?
- Which players make the cut most frequently?
- What are the playing attributes of top-ranked players?

## 🧩 Process Overview

1. **Data Preparation & Import**
   - Explored dataset structure, field formats, and data consistency
   - Cleaned and prepared raw data for analysis

2. **Data Transformation (SQL)**
   - Created multiple relational tables
   - Extracted relevant metrics and features
   - Wrote optimized queries to derive insights

3. **Power BI Dashboard Development**
   - Designed relationships for efficient data modeling
   - Created dynamic visualizations and slicers
   - Enabled intuitive comparisons across tournaments, players, and seasons
